        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Description</h3>
        <p>SAKAMOTO is an 8-bit side-scrolling motorcycle racing game that draws inspiration from the “Bōsōzoku” - notorious biker gangs who settled their disputes through what’s called a “race duel”. In the game, players customize their motorcycles and compete against AI or other real players. Obstacles include increasing minimum speeds, hindrances from other riders, and randomly generated environmental obstacles. To win, players must control their speed, manage their fuel and game props, avoid obstacles, and take down rivals to be the last one riding.</p>
    
        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-4">Essential In-Race UI Components:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Display of the game</li>
            <li>Game statistics (rival count, rival's health points, current minimum speed, etc.)</li>
            <li>Bike information (fuel level, speed, degree of damage, etc.)</li>
            <li>Summary of props (quantity remaining, function, etc.)</li>
            <li>Action log (documenting each player's moves during the game)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-4">Essential Off-Race UI Components:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>List of bikes owned by the player</li>
            <li>Summary of bike's condition and statistics</li>
            <li>List of components for customizing bikes</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>My plan is to prioritize building all the essential in-race UI components. If time permits, I will also work on developing some of the essential off-race UI components.</p>
